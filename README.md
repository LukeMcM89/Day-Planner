# Day-Planner
An easy to use day planner that provides individualized blocks of time with the ability to insert, save and/or delete notes, memos or tentative plans to help orientate and manage your day. Save functionality is included.

Past hour blocks are gray, while the current hour block is green. Red colored time slots are future time blocks. 

Rather than do a work schedule app only, I went further and made it a complete day planner, with the full spectrum, from 12am-11pm. 

Thank you for your time!
