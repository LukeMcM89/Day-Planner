# Day-Planner
A easy to use day planner that provides individulaized blocks of time with the ability to insert, save and/or delete notes, memos or tentative plans top help orientate and manage your day.

Rather than do a work schedule app only, I went further and made it a complete day planner, with the full spectrum, from 12am-11pm. 

Thank you for your time!
